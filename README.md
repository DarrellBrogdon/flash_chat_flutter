# flash_chat_flutter

This is a re-creation of the "flash_chat_flutter" app as part of [_The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp_](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart).  The  version that the course currently provides uses old Android and iOS libraries which causes compilation errors.  

Instead of trying to migrate everything to the latest versions, I recreated the project.

This repostory includes all the lessons up to and including [_Firebase Flutter Packages Setup (iOS & Android)_](https://www.appbrewery.co/courses/548873/lectures/9989900) which should get you past any of the compilation problems you may have encountered.
